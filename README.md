# Description

This is a solver written to solve the **two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized using the Finite-Volume Method on a staggered grid** [[1]](#1). The problem solved is lid-driven cavity flow with the upper wall provided a velocity and the other walls kept stationary.
